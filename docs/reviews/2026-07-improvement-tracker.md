# memhub Improvement Review — Execution Tracker

**Source of truth:** [`2026-07-improvement-review.md`](2026-07-improvement-review.md)
(1,190 lines; findings F1–F17, P1–P22, N1–N28, decisions Q1–Q56, waves 0–9).
This file records **what has been done** so no session re-investigates a closed item.
Update it in the same commit that closes an item — status + commit/PR reference.

**Legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` won't do / superseded
Each done item carries `— <date> <commit-or-PR>`.

**Sequencing rule (from §12):** resolve `§11` decisions *per wave, not all up front*.
Every wave that touches recall scoring / embedding / bundle shape must re-run the
golden evals (`memhub eval retrieval`, `eval locate`, polyglot fixture) and record the
numbers. Default-off config additions must keep an untouched install byte-identical.

## Post-review inbox — new asks beyond the July review (added 2026-07-06)

Captured from a working session; **not** part of the July review's F/P/N/Q taxonomy and
**not** wired into the active Wave 2 chain. Each needs its own scoping pass → plan gate →
issues before execution. IDs are `A#` to keep them distinct from the review's findings.

- [ ] **A1 — Onboarding / install-prompt feature-coverage audit (all 3 CLIs).** Ensure a
  new user running the install/onboarding path — CLI `memhub init` (+ its epilogue) and the
  `/init-project` skill in Claude / Codex / OpenCode — is offered **every current feature and
  toggle**, not just the pre-M9 set the onboarding was designed around. Since-PRD additions to
  surface: `[retrieval] mode` + `use_reranker`; machine-global store (`global enable`); metrics
  (`metrics enable` + `recall_proxy` / `session_accounting` sub-switches); doc-ingest (+
  `include_docs_in_default`); code-index warm-up (`code index`); Drive sync (`sync enable` +
  `drive_subpath`); tokenizer `metrics calibrate`. **Related/subsumes:** review N10/Q50 (init
  epilogue + `init --profile` / `doctor --setup` interview). **Open decision:** epilogue-only
  vs an interactive setup interview; which toggles default-on. Effort: med.

- [ ] **A2 — README refresh + visual assets.** Beyond Wave 0's F4 factual fixes: add diagrams /
  screenshots. Candidates: the M10 Drive-sync model (VACUUM-INTO snapshot + manifest into an
  OS-synced folder, fully offline), the recall pipeline (FTS BM25 + BGE-small vector → cross-
  encoder rerank), the `/viz` dashboard, the render/category flow. **Considerations:** commit
  assets as SVG / optimized PNG under `docs/assets/` (never in the binary — offline-first
  unaffected); diagrams can be generated via the dataviz/artifact tooling. **Open decision:**
  which diagrams; SVG vs PNG; asset location. Effort: med, low risk.

- [ ] **A3 — Storage-category review + user-defined categories.** Review the fixed durable set —
  today `SourceType::{Fact, Decision, Task, DocChunk}` (recall-scored) plus write-only session
  **notes** and **commands** (`record_command`); "arch" is narrative in rendered `PROJECT.md`,
  not an entity — and decide add/trim, **plus a mechanism for user-defined categories** (example:
  an "API memory" bucket). **Architecture-adjacent — cascades** across schema (each type is its
  own table + FTS + embeddings + triggers today), retrieval scoring & `source_type` filters,
  render sections, MCP `propose_*` / `*_add` surfaces, and the "agents are untrusted writers"
  guardrail. **Spectrum:** (a) *light* — optional `kind` / tag on facts (= review **W4**, Wave 6)
  + filter/render by kind; (b) *medium* — a first-class user-category registry with per-category
  retrieval/render; (c) *heavy* — a generic typed-memory subsystem. Tension with the
  "intentionally boring / narrow milestones / no speculative subsystems" guardrail. **Leaning:**
  start at (a)/W4 to satisfy "API memory" cheaply, promote to (b) only if first-class treatment is
  genuinely needed. **Open decision (yours — load-bearing, gates the schema design):** how far up
  the spectrum. Effort: (a) small · (b) large · (c) very large.

- [ ] **A4 — Optional hosted-LLM reranker (per-agent provider) with local fallback.** Let a user who has
  hosted-LLM API access opt into using **a hosted LLM as the recall reranker** (Anthropic Haiku under
  Claude, an OpenAI fast tier under Codex, an OpenCode-configured provider under OpenCode), falling back
  to the bundled local cross-encoder (ms-marco-MiniLM) whenever the hosted call is unavailable or offline. **Scope correction (load-bearing):**
  this applies to the **rerank/judgment stage only** — the BGE-small *embedding* step cannot use Haiku
  (Anthropic exposes no embeddings endpoint; a hosted embedding option would mean a separate provider —
  Voyage / OpenAI / Cohere / Gemini — plus full-corpus re-embedding + a vector-dimension migration, a
  much larger change with weaker payoff). The rerank stage slots into memhub's existing two-stage
  reranker seam (the `use_reranker` knob), so a `[retrieval] reranker = "local" | "hosted"` toggle is
  architecturally natural. **Cross-agent generalization (added 2026-07-06 — the load-bearing broadening):
  the hosted reranker must NOT be Anthropic/Claude-only.** memhub is a shared tool called from all three
  agents, and the feature has to behave identically under Codex and OpenCode. Design it as a *provider
  abstraction*, not a Haiku special-case: one `HostedReranker` trait behind the existing `use_reranker`
  seam, with backends `{anthropic (Haiku), openai (a fast/cheap GPT tier for Codex), opencode
  (provider-agnostic — follow OpenCode's configured provider, or an explicit memhub setting)}`. The
  default provider is auto-selected from the **detected calling client** (reuse the existing
  `normalize_client_name` mapping — memhub already knows whether Claude / Codex / OpenCode invoked it,
  per F15/P7), overridable via `[retrieval] reranker_provider`. Every backend degrades to the bundled
  local cross-encoder; all backends default-off; local stays the shipped default everywhere. *(Exact
  model IDs per provider — e.g. which OpenAI small model best mirrors Haiku — are a research item; do
  not hardcode a guess.)* **Upside:** an LLM understands query intent better than a small cross-encoder
  → smarter relevance, and it overlaps the contradiction/staleness judgment in Wave 3 L5. **Tensions
  (all load-bearing):** (1) collides with the offline-first / "no cloud service or daemon" security
  invariant → must be strictly opt-in with local fallback as default, and it is a **PRD-level decision**,
  not a mere config toggle; (2) hot-path latency + rate-limit/outage exposure on *every* recall (recall
  is called mid-conversation, sometimes repeatedly); (3) each recall becomes a billable call (the metrics
  subsystem could measure it); (4) **determinism** — the golden Recall@K / N28 hermetic eval regime
  assumes deterministic local ranking; an LLM reranker drifts across model updates even at temperature 0,
  which cuts against the eval-gated culture. **Leaning:** bounded escalation, not a wholesale swap —
  local FTS+BGE stays the always-on fast path; Haiku reranks only a small top-slice, or on explicit
  request / hard queries, capping latency, cost, and eval-drift. **Added cross-agent tensions:**
  (5) **credentials** — memhub would need its own per-provider API key (Anthropic / OpenAI / …) read from
  env or `[retrieval]` config, **never committed**; a missing/invalid key must degrade to local, not error
  the recall (fail-*safe-to-local*, since local ranking is the secure default — distinct from the general
  fail-closed rule); (6) **determinism now spans N providers** — each hosted backend drifts independently
  across model updates, so the hermetic golden regime (N28) must stay pinned to the local reranker and
  hosted backends are excluded from the gate (or get a separate, explicitly-opt-in, non-hermetic eval).
  **New dep:** one HTTP client (flag-before-add) + a PRD amendment (this is a PRD-level, provider-neutral
  decision, not a mere config toggle). **Open decisions (yours):** (a) pursue at all? (b) provider-selection
  model — auto-by-calling-client vs explicit config (leaning: auto-detect with override); (c) OpenCode —
  first-class provider vs "bring-your-own configured provider"; (d) escalation policy (always / top-slice /
  on-request) and default-off confirmed for every backend. **Effort:** med (rerank-only, one provider) ·
  med-large (all three agent providers + provider abstraction + credential handling) · large (only if a
  hosted *embedding* option is ever added). **Path note:** the per-provider API integration may need
  research, or can be built from inside the target agent itself (e.g. implement/verify the Codex/OpenAI
  backend from within Codex) if doing it from Claude Code proves impractical. *(Captured 2026-07-06 from a
  design conversation; broadened to cross-agent 2026-07-06. Needs its own scoping pass → plan gate →
  issues before execution.)*

## Wave 0 — Fix-now (broken today; all small)

Four PRs: **PR-A text/docs** and **PR-B safe code** (no decisions), **PR #17**
(F11, decision Q39), and **PR #18** (F1, decision Q29) — **Wave 0 complete.**

### PR-A — text/docs (zero decisions)
- [x] **F13/P3** — fixed invalid YAML frontmatter: folded `description:` to block
  scalar (`>`) in recall/locate/doc/metrics templates ×3 agents + added dependency-free
  regression guard `skill_frontmatter_descriptions_are_valid_yaml_scalars` in
  `tests/skill_parity.rs`. — 2026-07-05, PR-A (wave0/pr-a-text).
  *Installed-copy resync via `memhub upgrade` is a post-merge machine step (still pending).*
- [x] **F5** — removed skill/MCP description falsehoods (docs-in-default flipped by
  decision 90; `sync-md` "managed block" that doesn't exist; "unproven until M11 PR5"
  remnant). Files: `templates/skills/**`, `src/mcp/mod.rs`, `src/cli/args.rs`.
  — 2026-07-05, PR #13 (wave0/pr-a-falsehoods).
- [x] **F4** — README: fixed the `[retrieval]` duplicate-table instruction (×4 install
  paths), added the Claude MCP registration step, fixed the self-contradictory
  `propose_fact` global bullet. — 2026-07-05, PR #13 (wave0/pr-a-falsehoods).
- [x] **F8** — added root `LICENSE` (MIT, © 2026 kninetimmy) + `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`
  covering both models (BGE-small MIT, ms-marco reranker Apache-2.0 — verified on the
  upstream cross-encoder HF card), the 7 tree-sitter grammar crates (MIT), uPlot (MIT),
  and the vendored tiktoken vocab (MIT); full MIT + Apache-2.0 texts reproduced.
  — 2026-07-05, PR-A (wave0/pr-a-text).
- [x] **F14/P9** — removed the non-existent `--json` from `integrations enable-k9` in
  both init-project variants (bootstrap-k9 `--json` verified valid, left intact).
  — 2026-07-05, PR-A (wave0/pr-a-text).
- [x] **F16/N13** — done in **PR-B** (message wording + exit-code fix share the same
  `cli/mod.rs` lines). — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] text-pass riders: **P8** (`/check-init-k9`, `/init-project-k9`, wrap-up
  "project-scoped" falsehood), **P10** (stale locate-reranker rationale in skills +
  `--help`), **P11** (AGENTS.md Codex-accounting note, every clause false), **P12**
  (root files cite a non-existent "re-render" MCP rule), **P17** (upgrade-resync omits
  OpenCode), **P18** (OpenCode recall stub `available_docs`), **N11** (sync courier prose —
  also corrected the same wording in `src/config/mod.rs` and `src/commands/sync.rs`).
  — 2026-07-05, PR #13 (wave0/pr-a-falsehoods).

### PR-B — safe code (zero decisions)
- [x] **F2a** — machine workaround: set `claude_transcripts_dir`, run `metrics rescan`;
  accounting restored (120→129 sessions). — 2026-07-05, local config (not committed; per-machine)
- [x] **F2b** — code fix: `detect_claude_transcripts_dir`/`detect_codex_sessions_dir` use
  `db::home_dir()`; new `encode_claude_project_dir` strips `\\?\` and maps `/`,`\`,`:`→`-`
  (no leading dash on Windows), preserving the Unix leading-dash shape byte-for-byte.
  Pure-fn Windows+Unix shape test. — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F3** — reconciler caps an open session's window at `started_at +
  OPEN_SESSION_MAX_HOURS` (12h) instead of `now`, so a sync-adopted zombie can't swallow
  local recalls; `sync adopt` also closes foreign open `session_metrics` rows post-swap.
  Lib + integration tests both directions. — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F6** — Windows staged handoff exits `3` (handed off, pending) not `0`; finish-child
  `unwrap_or(0)`→`unwrap_or(1)`; `last_upgrade.json` gains a `state` field; new `memhub
  upgrade --verify-last` (exits 0/1/3). — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F7** — `apply_all` refuses a DB whose `schema_migrations` holds a version newer
  than the compiled list (points at `memhub upgrade`); `upsert_project` ratchets
  `schema_version` with `MAX(...)` so an older binary can't downgrade it. Tests.
  — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F9** — pinned `PRAGMA recursive_triggers = OFF` in both `open_connection` and
  `open_code_index`; corrected the inverted migration 0014 comment (trigger fires on
  direct chunk deletes only, not the FK cascade). — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F10** — reordered `embed_missing`: query `missing` first and early-return before
  the full-table embedding-cache decode (skips it per warm `locate`).
  — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F12/P16** — `snapshot()` runs `check` first and refuses on `drive-ahead`/`diverged`
  without `--force`/`force=true` (CLI `--force`, MCP `sync_snapshot force`); all three
  wrap-up variants gain a `sync check` step. Test both branches.
  — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F15/P7** — mapped `codex-mcp-client`→`codex` in `normalize_client_name`; warn on
  unmapped client names. Test. — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).
- [x] **F16/N13** code half — `doc rm`/`doc show` `process::exit(1)` on an ident miss
  (JSON `{"removed"/"found": false}` body still printed).
  — 2026-07-05, PR-B (wave0/pr-b-safe-code).

### Gated (later in Wave 0)
- [x] **F1** — added `--json` to `status`, `init`, `fact list`, `decision list`, `command
  list`; adopted the noun-keyed wrapped-object JSON convention (`{"status":{...}}`,
  `{"facts":[...]}`, etc.) per **Q29**, and migrated `doc ls --json` from a bare array to
  `{"docs":[...]}` to match. `tests/cli_args.rs` adds the clap-surface smoke test (N24).
  — 2026-07-05, PR #18 (feat/15-json-cli-flags).
- [x] **F11** — MCP `doc_add` path confinement: canonicalize the agent-supplied path,
  require repo-root **or** a new `[doc] allowed_dirs` entry, apply the existing
  `PathMatcher` deny-list on top (a deny-listed path inside repo-root still refuses).
  Gate lives on the MCP path only (`doc_add_impl`); CLI `doc add` / `prepare_doc` is
  unchanged and stays unrestricted. **Gated on Q39** (resolved: repo-root + allowlist,
  not repo-root-only). — 2026-07-05, PR #17.

### Immediate / no-PR
- [x] **F17/N20** — committed `docs/reviews/` (review + tracker), reachable from the Mac
  once PR #11 merges to main. — 2026-07-05, PR #11.
  *(N20's wrap-up untracked-path guard is a separate later enhancement, not this fix-now.)*

## Wave 1 — Loud states  (gating: Q35) — COMPLETE
- [x] S2 `memhub doctor` (absorbs `/check-init`, config-key validation, D1 integrity, X4
  health line, plus probes P1/P4, N21/N23). — 2026-07-06, PR #25 (issue #21).
- [x] S3 `status` refresh (subsystem states; K9 lines only when detected) — reuses doctor's
  side-effect-free checks. — 2026-07-06, PR #27 (issue #22).
- [x] D1 integrity surface (FTS rowcounts, FTS5 integrity-check, orphan embeddings,
  `integrity_check`+`foreign_key_check`) — absorbed into doctor (`check_integrity`).
  — 2026-07-06, PR #25 (issue #21).
- [x] X4 session-accounting health line — absorbed into doctor (`check_metrics_health`).
  — 2026-07-06, PR #25 (issue #21).
- [x] D9 map SQLITE_BUSY / SQLITE_LOCKED to a friendly error — shipped with D5/Q35
  (`synchronous = NORMAL` at both `open_connection` and `open_code_index`) in the same
  PR. — 2026-07-05, PR #23 (issue #20).
- [x] Wave 1·A follow-up — doctor flags `integrations.k9.enabled` drift and warns on sync
  `project_id_mismatch` / `schema_blocks_adopt`; module-doc accuracy fix.
  — 2026-07-06, PR #28 (issue #26).

## Wave 2 — Token diet  (gating: Q21–Q25 ✓ · Q41 ✓ — gate cleared 2026-07-06)
<!-- Rulings: Q21 generate AGENTS.md from CLAUDE.md (derived, content-equal parity).
     Q22 ~2,500-tok target; inline: Guardrails, Session Continuity, Delegation,
     stale-embeddings gate, sync_adopt gate. Q23 implement versioned managed block.
     Q24 fix — register `memhub serve` (confirmed 0 CLIs; registration lands Wave 4/Q40).
     Q25 opt-in `[audit] user_md_path`. Q41 fail-safe — keep a ~10-line compact routing
     block in AGENTS.md for Codex/OpenCode, trim CLAUDE.md's verbose routing; spike
     deferred to Wave 4 to decide whether even that block can go. -->
- [x] C1 rewrite repo CLAUDE.md to ~2,500-token target — cut 8,272→1,166 cl100k tok;
  subsystem prose relocated content-preserving into new `docs/reference/operations.md`.
  — 2026-07-06, PR #34 (issue #30).
- [x] C2 generate AGENTS.md from CLAUDE.md (pure `generate_agents_md`); upgraded
  `skill_parity` from `##`-header parity to content-equality. — 2026-07-06, PR #34 (issue #30).
- [x] C3 trim user-global CLAUDE.md — pure verbosity trim of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  (machine-local, outside this repo): 186→129 lines, 9,913→6,577 bytes (−33% bytes /
  −36% words), every rule preserved. Three structural merges (Prompt-refinement folded
  into a "How I want you to work" bullet; TODOs+dead-code; typecheck+test). User accepted
  −36% over pushing to the −40% target to keep the Subagent-Policy / Model-Fit rules at
  full fidelity. Backup at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.bak-2026-07-06`. Main-thread edit — no
  PR/issue (file lives outside the repo). — 2026-07-06.
- [x] C4 root managed block — versioned `memhub:managed-block` in `src/managed_block.rs`,
  propagates CLAUDE.md→AGENTS.md unchanged via the generator. — 2026-07-06, PR #35 (issue #31).
- [x] C5 `memhub audit md [--json] [--strict]` — read-only linter over root memory files:
  size (2,500 target / 2,600 ceiling), AGENTS.md drift (reuses #30 `generate_agents_md`),
  managed-block presence/version (reuses #31 `parse_managed_block`), keystone phrases
  (single-source const now shared with `skill_parity`), malformed/missing CLAUDE.md,
  opt-in `[audit] user_md_path`. `--json` → `{"audit_md":{...}}` (Q29); `--strict` exits 1
  iff ≥1 finding. No new deps, no DB writes. — 2026-07-06, PR #37 (issue #32).
- [x] C6 `/audit-md` skill (judgment layer) — read-only skill across all 3 agents
  (Claude/Codex/OpenCode + OpenCode command wrapper) wrapping `audit md --json`, with
  per-finding-id fix recommendations and a forward-compatible fallback for unknown ids;
  `skill_parity` stays green. — 2026-07-06, PR #38 (issue #33).
- [x] C7 `memhub upgrade` nag line — best-effort `check_audit_md` runs `audit md` under
  the fresh binary in `finish_phase` + `dry_run_report`, emits a single nag line only when
  findings exist (silent on clean), additive `audit_md` JSON field; degrades to a `Warn`
  row on audit error, structurally never fails the upgrade (returns `AuditNag`, not
  `Result`). New `tests/upgrade_audit_nag.rs`. — 2026-07-06, PR #38 (issue #33).
- [x] rider N4 keystone-phrase parity test — landed with C2. — 2026-07-06, PR #34 (issue #30).
- [ ] rider N1 MCP description diet — deferred to Wave 4 (same PR as Q40/R2)

## Wave 3 — Lifecycle  (gating: Q1–Q6 ✓ — resolved 2026-07-06 as decision 145)

Decomposed into 9 issues (#41–49): L1–L6 + Q5/Q6 + N28 (L7 declined). **Batch 1 done**
2026-07-06 — main green at `cea07ff` (638 tests); Batch 2: L2 (#57) ✓ → L3 (#59) ✓ → L4 (#60) ✓ → L5 (unblocked) → L6 (last).

- [x] L1 `memhub fact verify` (no add-upsert side effects) + wrap-up per-item step —
  touches `verified_at` only, off the MCP surface; per-item re-verify across all 3 agents.
  — 2026-07-06, PR #51 / cea07ff (issue #41).
- [x] L2 un-silence staleness: `[retrieval] fact_stale_after_days` + demote/flag stale facts
  (not silent exclusion; default flipped, `stale_facts_demoted` count surfaced).
  — 2026-07-06, PR #57 / 8c5bf2e (issue #45).
- [x] L3 wire supersession: migration 0018 (`facts.superseded_by` + `pending_writes.kind` CHECK
  +'supersede'), `fact/decision supersede` verbs, demote-with-link recall (`superseded_penalty`
  =0.4, stacks additively with stale_penalty) + render annotation, staged MCP `propose_supersede`
  (durable only on `review accept`). N28 held Recall@3=100%. Full-suite pre-flight caught + fixed a
  doctor false-warn on the new config key (`KNOWN_LEAVES` + range-check/`BASELINE_FIELDS` parity
  with stale_penalty). — 2026-07-06/07, PR #59 / 648f275 (issue #46).
- [x] L4 `memhub review stale` audit queue — strictly read-only union of 4 lifecycle signals
  (stale facts @ L2 config horizon w/ superseded excluded · aged done tasks · expired pending
  writes · doc hash-drift), each row naming the existing fix verb; `status` gains a stale-queue
  count via the same `stale()` call so the two can't disagree; `--json` as `{"review_stale":{...}}`
  (Q29); read-only invariant proven by a before/after rowcount+writes_log snapshot test. Full-suite
  pre-flight 671 green. — 2026-07-07, PR #60 / 3a87254 (issue #47).
- [ ] L5 accept-time contradiction probe — **unblocked** (L3 merged); tier:opus (#48)
- [ ] L6 optional age decay (default-off) — eval-gated, last; L3 dep cleared (#49)
- [-] L7 hard archival — **recommend against / defer** (per review)
- [x] rider: N28 hermetic retrieval golden fixture — `tests/retrieval_golden_hermetic.rs`
  drives the compiled binary against a seeded tempdir; baseline Recall@3 = 100% (the L2/L3/L6
  eval reference). — 2026-07-06, PR #53 / 6c64e32 (issue #44).

**Q5/Q6 also shipped this batch** (their own issues, tracked as decisions below):
- [x] Q5 retire the vestigial always-1.0 confidence surface field from CLI/render/MCP —
  2026-07-06, PR #52 / ef4a3e7 (issue #42). The parked viz-dashboard leftover (#54) retired
  2026-07-07, PR #58 / 732d20b.
- [x] Q6 automatic pending-write expiry at `open_project` — best-effort single autocommit
  side effect reusing the manual `review expire` core. — 2026-07-06, PR #50 / 66d3b5f (issue #43).
- Hotfix #55 / 79ef76c fixed a #50 `export_import` back-compat regression (auto-expiry expired
  an ancient imported pending write); caught by the full-suite gate on main. Every subsequent
  merge was pre-flighted with a throwaway local merge + full suite before the canonical squash.

## Wave 4 — Performance  (gating: Q17–Q19, Q24, Q40)
- [ ] R1 pre-warm models in `mcp::serve`
- [ ] R2 register MCP server (per Q40 all-three-CLIs)
- [ ] R3 batch doc-chunk embedding
- [ ] R5 `locate --no-refresh`
- [ ] R6 MCP recall bundle trim (+ add `rerank_score`)
- [ ] R8 debounce metrics maintenance
- [ ] R9 consolidate retrieval helpers; delete dead `min_vector_score`
- [ ] R10 evals: doc-chunk/global fixture sections + warm-latency p50
- [ ] R11 knob hygiene (split locate vs recall weights; `TEST_PATH_PENALTY` config)
- [ ] R12 record surface (CLI vs MCP) column in `recall_metrics`
- [ ] R7 int8-quantized ONNX — **separate eval-gated experiment** (Q18)
- [ ] R4 = F10 (tracked in Wave 0)

## Wave 5 — Upgrade / GC  (gating: Q12–Q16)
- [ ] U2 extend gc to `build/memhub-*` OUT_DIRs + `examples/` hashes
- [ ] U3 call `sweep_stale_staging` from `gc::run`
- [ ] U4 consolidate `tests/*.rs` into 1–3 harness binaries
- [ ] U5 revisit two shipped gc exclusions (superseded incremental; >100MB multi-hash third-party)
- [ ] U6 skill-resync honesty (orphan report, install manifest, symlink-fallback message)
- [ ] U7 degrade-don't-die on corrupt registry / PATH-shadow IO error
- [ ] U8 backups retention cap (N newest; legacy k9-bootstrap-backup prompt)

## Wave 6 — Wrap-up  (gating: Q7–Q11)
- [ ] W1 verbosity knob + `memhub wrapup-policy --json`
- [ ] W2 level semantics (minimal/standard/full/transcript)
- [ ] W3 transcript mode (zst archive + pointer row; excluded from recall/export)
- [ ] W4 optional `kind` tag on facts
- [ ] W5 `SourceType::Note` retrievable on explicit request
- [ ] W6 skill content fixes ×3 agents (record_command, --summary, OpenCode contract)

## Wave 7 — Cross-machine  (gating: Q30–Q33)
- [ ] X1 `sync check --diff`
- [ ] X2 import-time printed checklist (+ fix inverted docs hint)
- [ ] X3 metrics consolidation (after F2/F3 baselines accrue)
- [ ] X5 marker temp+rename; degrade unparseable marker
- [ ] X6 adopt pre-swap `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` probe

## Wave 8 — Infra  (gating: Q37–Q38)
- [ ] G1 CI (windows+macos build/test, SHA-keyed model cache, branch protection, cargo audit)
- [ ] G2 write-time secret-pattern warning

## Wave 9 — Housekeeping  (gating: Q26–Q27, Q36)
- [ ] S5 docs prune (NEXT_STEPS.md, current-architecture.md, milestones.md, roadmap archive, Source PRD/)
- [ ] G3 legacy surface disposition (`ingest-git`/`search`/`stats`/`bootstrap-k9`)
- [ ] D10 retire `chunks`/`chunk_fts` (after G3)
- [ ] D4 `memhub db maintain`
- [ ] D7 rendered-ledger cap
- [ ] D8 migration sha256 checksums + drift warning
- [ ] §10.6 minor gaps as judged (MEMHUB_LOG docs, fuzz tests, recovery runbook, file perms, SECURITY.md)
